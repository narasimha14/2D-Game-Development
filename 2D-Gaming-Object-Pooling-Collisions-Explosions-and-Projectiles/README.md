# 2D-Gaming-Object-Pooling-Collisions-Explosions-and-Projectiles
In this project, I have implemented further animations, actions and interactions to the player sprite and functions to allow it to jump in addition to moving forward and backward. The player can now shoot boomerangs to kill the monkeys and save the girl he's after. There is a HUD that displays the FPS, time elapsed, help to control the player, etc. It appears at the start of the game and disappears after 2 seconds ( is configurable via the xml) but can be brought up by pressing the F1 key. There is another HUD that displays the object pool i.e. the bullet list and the free list. This HUD can be displayed using F2 key. There is also a health bar that decreases over time ( duration configurable via xml). The health starts at 50% which can be increased by collecting the bananas on the way. If the health is zero, the player explodes and you have to press "r" to restart the game. The antagonists in my game are the monkeys which can be shot by throwing boomerangs. If the player collides with the monkey, both of them explode but the player respawns at the same position. I have used per pixel collision detection strategy in my game.  In order to further move the game plot, when the player reaches the girl after battling through all the monkeys, I have made the master antagonist Sher Khan to appear at the end of the game and challenge him for a duel. Hence the game name, "Jungle Book: Return of the Sher Khan". I have also added sounds to some of the events like the player jump, shoots, Sher Khan entrance along with a short music that plays when the game ends. I had to modify the Makefile to link the SDL_mixer library. I have made some changes to the default sound.cpp such that the previous sound does not stop playing when a new sound is being played.  How you made your sprites: All the background sprites(the trees, the grassland) I created myself using Gimp Editor. The mountain background is a picture of a real mountain (Z-point, Kemmannugundi, India) which I captured myself. Mowgli, the girl, Sher Khan, the leaf, the boomerang and the monkey sprites were downloaded from the internet.
