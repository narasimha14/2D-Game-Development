# 2D-Gaming-Final-Game
In this project, a playable game that reaches a conclusion was developed. The game plot starts with a girl screaming for help as she is damn scared of the monkeys taunting her. Hearing her cry for help, our hero mowgli starts out to help her. He has to fight all the monkeys in his way but he has another major obstacle waiting for him at the end. Just when he thinks he has rescued the girl and the girl is all his, Sher Khan appears out of no where. Will he survive the big, wild, evil cat? Mowgli's fate (and in turn that of his love life) depends on YOU! Shoot boomerangs to kill the monkeys and Sher Khan. Watch out for your health as it keeps decreasing over time and also when Sher Khan is nearby you. 

**AI:** Sher Khan is the intelligent sprite here. Sher Khan follows Mowgli in both forward and backward directions, and whenever it is nearby Mowgli it jumps onto him. GOD Mode: Press 'g' to activate/deactivate God Mode. Mowgli will become invincible when in GOD mode.  
**How I got my sprites:** All the background sprites(the trees, the grassland) I created myself using Gimp Editor. The mountain background is a picture of a real mountain (Z-point, Kemmannugundi, India) which I captured myself. Mowgli, the girl, Sher Khan, the leaf, the boomerang and the monkey sprites were downloaded from the internet.
