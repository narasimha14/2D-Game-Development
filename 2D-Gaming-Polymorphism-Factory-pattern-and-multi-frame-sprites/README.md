# 2D-Gaming-Polymorphism-Factory-pattern-and-multi-frame-sprites
In this project, I have implemented an advanced animation in which there were multi-framed sprites to allow for the sprite animation, two-way sprites which changes the direction on hitting the walls of the world and also a basic sprite. For this project, I have chosen "The Jungle Book"  as my theme and I have Mowgli, Bhageera and a bird as my two-way multi sprites. I have included Sher Khan and a monkey as two stationary animated multi-sprites. In my case, the basic sprite is a leaf. I have capped the frame rate to 60 FPS. Two-way sprites were implemented by having a flipped version of the image frames in the second half of the same image and then iterating through both the halves as per our requirement.I have also included an offset tag in the xml file, so that Mowgli and Bhageera change their direction when they approach Sher Khan. I obtained my sprites over the internet and modified them using Gimp, so that they were equally spaced to allow for extraction of the frames for the Multi-Sprite.
